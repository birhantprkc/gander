Issue #20: drawing the page again at the zoom the reader is actually at.

A page bitmap is drawn once and pinch zoom is the compositor magnifying it, so
past the point where it runs out of pixels the reader is looking at an upscale.
pdf.html now draws the part of the page on screen a second time, at the live
zoom, as a tile laid over the page.

These drive real page scale through CDP, which is what the WebView's pinch is:
a step applied after rendering that moves visualViewport and leaves the layout
alone. Playwright's own zoom would not do, because it changes layout instead.

One thing to know when reading the numbers: devicePixelRatio is 1 here where a
phone is 2 or more, so the constants come out smaller than on a device. Every
assertion below is therefore about a relationship rather than an absolute, and
holds at any density.
