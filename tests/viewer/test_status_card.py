The card a viewer shows while a document opens.

It waits before it appears, so a document that opens quickly never shows it; how long, and
why that long, is beside .vw-wait in app.css. Anything a script puts in the card afterwards
is never held back: an error, the password prompt, and the line shown once a password has
been entered.
