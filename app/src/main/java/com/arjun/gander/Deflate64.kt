/**
 * Deflate64, which a zip records as method 9 and PKWARE calls enhanced deflating. Issue #30.
 *
 * It is deflate with three changes: a window of 64 KB rather than 32, deflate's two unused
 * distance codes given the reach into it, and the last length code taking sixteen extra bits
 * rather than meaning 258, so that one match can repeat up to 65,538 bytes. Windows' own Send
 * to compressed folder writes it for any file over 2 GB, and 7-Zip on request. zlib has never
 * read it, so neither can java.util.zip, and this is the whole of it: an inflater written
 * from RFC 1951 with those three changes, and nothing else.
 *
 * One table lookup per symbol. Each code's table is as wide as its longest code, so the next
 * that many bits index straight to the symbol and how many of the bits it used.
