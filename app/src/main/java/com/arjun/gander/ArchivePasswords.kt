/**
 * The password that opened a zip's files, for as long as its list is open. Issue #30.
 *
 * Held here, in memory, and nowhere else. Not in the URI a viewer is given, because a viewer
 * passes its URI on when a file is shared, and not on storage, which would make the promise
 * that nothing in a zip is written to the phone untrue in the one place it matters most. The
 * list forgets it when the reader leaves, and a process Android reclaims forgets it too, which
 * at worst means typing it again.
 *
 * One per archive, since a zip nearly always has one password for everything in it. A file
 * that turns out to have another asks for that, and the newer one is kept.
