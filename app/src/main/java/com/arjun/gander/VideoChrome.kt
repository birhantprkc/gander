/**
 * The title bar and the phone's bars over a video: they float over the picture and come and go
 * with the player's own controls. Issue #33.
 *
 * Everywhere else the title bar sits above the document and the viewer keeps clear of the phone's
 * bars, which suits a page and not a film. In landscape the three of them took about a third of
 * the screen's height, and hiding any of them where they stood would have resized the picture
 * every time the controls came and went. So for a video the picture fills the screen, the title
 * bar is lifted over its top edge with its own colour carried up behind the clock, the controls
 * keep clear of wherever the phone's bars can be, and nothing moves when the bars do. One tap
 * brings everything back, and it all goes again with the controls, unless the title bar or a menu
 * or box opened from it is in use.
 *
 * A film is dark whatever the phone is set to, so the parts over it take the colours a night-mode
 * PDF gives them, the ones a phone set to dark has: a paper bar over a picture is the one bright
 * thing in the room.
 *
 * Under a screen reader nothing goes. A view that has faded out cannot be reached by swiping, and
 * the title bar holds Back and the menu; the page readout stays up there for the same reason.
