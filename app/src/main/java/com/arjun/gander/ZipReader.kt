/**
 * Reading a .zip where it is: what is in it, and any one file out of it. Issue #30.
 *
 * A zip keeps an index of everything in it at its end, the central directory, and listing
 * an archive reads only that, so a two gigabyte archive lists as quickly as a small one.
 * A file is read by going to where the index says it starts and inflating that one file
 * on its way to whoever asked. Nothing is written anywhere.
 *
 * java.util.zip does most of this already and cannot be used for it, for reasons measured
 * on API 36. ZipFile needs a path, which a file from the picker or another app never has.
 * ZipInputStream has no index, so listing a large archive means inflating all of it. Both
 * turn every name not written as UTF-8 into U+FFFD, which is what ZipNames is for. And
 * ZipFile refuses a whole archive if any one entry in it is encrypted. What is used from it
 * is Inflater, which is sound, and is the platform's own: no library, nothing added to the
 * download. What Inflater cannot read, Deflate64 and a file under a password, is Gander's own
 * too, in Deflate64.kt and ZipEncryption.kt.
