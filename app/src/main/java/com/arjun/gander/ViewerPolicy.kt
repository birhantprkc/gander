/**
 * The Content Security Policy every viewer page runs under.
 *
 * A document is untrusted input to a renderer that was not written with attackers in
 * mind, and two of the vendored ones write document text into the page as markup:
 * PPTXjs puts slide text and link tooltips through jQuery's html(), and docx-preview
 * copies link targets into href unchecked and draws a Word file's embedded HTML in a
 * frame of its own. Without a policy, script in a crafted file would run as the page.
 * What stopped it reaching anything was the missing INTERNET permission and the Kotlin
 * side's refusal to serve anything but the assets and the document; this is a third
 * wall, inside the page, so that script from a document does not run in the first place.
 *
 * Directive by directive:
 * - Scripts only from Gander's own files. No inline script, no event-handler
 *   attributes, no javascript: URLs, no eval. 'wasm-unsafe-eval' is for pdf.js's image
 *   decoders, which are WebAssembly, and allows compiling that and nothing else.
 * - Styles from Gander's files and inline, because docx-preview, PPTXjs, SheetJS and
 *   pdf.js's text layer all write style attributes. A style cannot reach anything
 *   either: every url() in one is held to img-src and font-src.
 * - Images, fonts and media from the page's own host, or from data: and blob: URLs,
 *   which are bytes the page already holds. That covers the document at /doc/ and the
 *   pictures, fonts and clips the renderers unpack from it.
 * - Fetches and workers only to the page's own host: the document, the pdf.js worker,
 *   its character maps and decoders.
 * - No frames, plugins, form submissions or base URL. docx-preview's frame for embedded
 *   HTML is a srcdoc one, which frame-src does not govern: it inherits this policy
 *   instead, and docx.js sandboxes it besides.
 *
 * Carried twice. Every page names it in a meta tag, so the test server, which serves the
 * files as they are, enforces the same policy the app does. [ViewerActivity] also sends it
 * as a header on every asset it serves, which is the only way it reaches the pdf.js
 * worker: a worker takes its policy from its own script's response, not from the page.
 * ViewerPolicyTest holds the two to the same text.
