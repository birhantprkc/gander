 * The names inside a .zip, decoded. Issue #30.
 *
 * A zip stores each name as bytes and one flag, and the flag only ever means UTF-8. Without
 * it the format says code page 437, which no Windows tool has taken literally: Explorer
 * writes the machine's own DOS code page, GBK on a Chinese Windows, CP866 on a Russian one,
 * Shift_JIS on a Japanese one, and leaves the flag clear. macOS writes UTF-8 and leaves it
 * clear as well.
 *
 * Android's own java.util.zip reads all of these as UTF-8 and puts U+FFFD wherever that
 * fails, without an error: a zip of Chinese folder names lists as rows of question marks,
 * and the bytes that said what they were are gone by the time there is a String. Measured
 * on API 36, and the system Files app shows such a zip the same way.
 *
 * Nothing in the file says which code page it was, and neither obvious tool can tell. ICU's
 * charset detector is not public API on Android. Decoding strictly and keeping whatever does
 * not fail cannot choose: GBK bytes decode without one error under eleven of the fourteen
 * charsets tried, and Japanese names decode under GBK into Chinese characters that are all
 * real and all wrong. What separates the candidates is whether the result is text people
 * write, so each one is scored on that over every such name in the archive together, and
 * the phone's language decides whatever the score leaves tied.
 *
 * Korean and Chinese are the pair that scoring by kind of character cannot split. A Korean
 * Windows zip's names are Hangul in rows the GBK table fills with its commonest hanzi, so
 * both readings are made of nothing but everyday characters, and the tie went to Chinese on
 * every phone not set to Korean. What does split them is which everyday characters: read as
 * Korean, the bytes are the syllables Korean is mostly written in, and read as Chinese, the
 * same bytes are characters Chinese rarely uses. See [COMMON_BONUS].
 *
 * A guess can still be wrong, most of all for an archive of one short name, so the reader
 * can also say which code page it is: [CHOICES].
