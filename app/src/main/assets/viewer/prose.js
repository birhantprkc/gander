 *
 * The file's first bytes choose, and its name does not. These three are the formats
 * whose names lie: a ".doc" is Rich Text about as often as not, because for twenty years
 * that was the easy way for a program that was not Word to produce something Word would
 * open, and Word never minded. Every one of the three starts with bytes that nothing
 * else starts with, so asking the file is both simpler and right more often than
 * asking its name.
