 * this it would be some six hundred kilobytes carried to draw one kind of file, where the
 * whole of what an STL needs is here: triangles into a buffer, one light, and a camera that
 * turns about the model. WebGL 1, which every WebView Gander runs on has, and nothing in
 * the script newer than the Chromium 58 that Android 8 shipped with, so this page has no
 * floor of its own.
 *
 * The triangles go to the graphics card in pieces as the file is read (see model-stl.js)
 * and are not kept on the page as well. That makes the card the only copy, and a card can
 * be taken away: Android is free to reclaim a WebView's graphics context, most often while
 * the app is in the background. When that happens the file is simply read again.
 *
 * Z is up, as it is in every slicer and in the CAD programs STL files come out of, and the
 * model opens seen from the front right and a little above. One finger turns it freely, the
 * way the finger goes, two pinch to zoom about the point between them and move it, and a
 * double tap puts it back.
