"""Draws the launcher icon's themed layer from the icon itself.

Why this exists
---------------
With themed icons on (Android 13 and later), the launcher draws an app's <monochrome> layer in
one colour taken from the wallpaper, on a background of another, and reads nothing from it but
alpha. The foreground cannot be that layer as it stands: its white cards, dark goose and coloured
badges would all come out the same colour, as one blob.

So this redraws the same picture in one colour. The goose stays solid, with its cheek patch and
eye cut out. The cards become outlines, and each one hides what is behind it with a thin gap. The
front card keeps its badge and two lines. The back two keep only their outline and folded corner,
because at launcher size their part-hidden badges and line ends read as specks. Every shape comes
from ic_launcher_foreground.xml, so a redrawn icon needs only a rerun.

Usage
-----
    pip install skia-pathops fonttools
    python3 scripts/make-monochrome-icon.py
