"""Draws the Gander wordmark as an Android VectorDrawable.

Why this exists
---------------
The site has set the wordmark in a geometric sans since the beginning:

    .wordmark { font-family: var(--geo); font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.035em; }
    --geo: Futura, "Century Gothic", "Avenir Next", Avenir, "Trebuchet MS", sans-serif;

Not one of those five ships on Android. The stack falls through to `sans-serif`, which is
Roboto, so every phone visitor to the site has been reading the wordmark in Roboto and the
app inherited the same silent fallback. It has only ever looked like Futura on a Mac.

Fixing that in the app means either shipping a font or shipping the letters. Six glyphs used
in exactly one place do not need a font: the drawable is about 4 kB of path data on disk and
compresses to under 2 kB in the APK, against 3.7 MB for the whole thing. It renders
identically on every device, and it cannot fall back to something else without anyone
noticing, which is the failure being fixed.

The trade is that a drawable is a picture. It carries a contentDescription rather than being
read as text, and it does not grow when someone raises their system font size. That was a
deliberate call; a subset font in res/font/ is the alternative if it ever needs to scale.

Why Jost and not Futura
-----------------------
Futura is on this Mac, and it is licensed by Apple and Paratype. Its outlines cannot be
extracted into a mark that ships inside an APK. Jost is Owen Earl's Futura revival, released
under the SIL Open Font Licence, and it is what the mockups were drawn in.

The SIL OFL FAQ treats outlines extracted into a logo as artwork rather than font software,
which is why no entry is added to assets/licences.md for it. Worth reading the FAQ yourself
before a release rather than taking that on trust.

Usage
-----
    curl -L -o Jost.ttf \\
      'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/jost/Jost%5Bwght%5D.ttf'
    python3 scripts/make-wordmark.py Jost.ttf

Writes app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_wordmark.xml. The font itself is not committed: it is
only ever needed to regenerate the drawable.
