# Contributing to Gander

Thanks for taking a look. Gander is intentionally small; the best contributions
keep it that way.

## Ground rules

- The zero-permission, zero-network property is non-negotiable. PRs that add
  INTERNET, storage permissions, analytics, or network calls will be declined.
- Prefer small, focused PRs over large rewrites.
- New file formats are welcome when they can render fully offline with a
  reasonably sized open source renderer.

## Building

See the "Build from source" section in the README. `./gradlew assembleDebug`
produces an installable build without any signing setup.

## Testing changes

Two suites and lint, all run by CI on every pull request:

```sh
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # Kotlin: routing, ranges, the port protocol
./gradlew lintDebug              # fails on any warning not in app/lint-baseline.xml
pip install -r tests/viewer/requirements.txt
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
pytest tests/viewer              # the viewer pages, in a real browser
```

The viewer tests drive the shipped HTML unmodified, against a local server
that mimics the Android side: same paths, same query parameters, same range
handling. So a change to `pdf.html` can be checked in a second rather than by
sideloading a build.

Reference screenshots are Linux-only, because text rasterises differently on
macOS. From a Mac, run them the way CI does:

```sh
scripts/test-viewer-visual.sh                    # compare
scripts/test-viewer-visual.sh --update-goldens   # after a deliberate change
```

Device tests exist too, and run nightly rather than per pull request. They
need an emulator whose WebView is Chromium 125 or newer:

```sh
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Fixtures are generated, not hand-made. If you need a new one, add it to
`tests/fixtures/make_fixtures.py` and re-run it; see `tests/fixtures/README.md`
for the rule about invented content.

## Adding a format

The list of what Gander opens lives in more than one place, and
`FormatRegistryTest` fails until they agree. In order:

1. The extension, and the MIME type if there is one, in `FileKind.kt`.
2. The MIME type in **both** intent filters in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
3. A fixture in `tests/fixtures/make_fixtures.py`.
4. A row in the table at the top of `FileKindTest`.
5. A new renderer page also needs a `tests/viewer/test_<page>.py`, a line in
   `test_theme.py`, and an entry in `ViewerFormatsTest`. A new *kind* needs no
   tile of its own, since the ninth says ETC and stands for the kinds without
   one; it does need naming in the `welcome_formats_spoken` string, which is
   what a screen reader hears in place of the tiles.

The viewer routes by extension first, MIME second, in `FileKind.kt`;
WebView-based renderers live in `app/src/main/assets/viewer/`.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with the file type, what you expected, what happened, and if
possible a sample file that reproduces it (strip anything private first).
